# CodeX_testTask
Data Warehouse implementation for a note keeping service.

#Usage cases
1. The designed API allows using http requests to save both data about created notes and their authors, as well as some important metrics for business (such as page loading time, navigation button clicks, time to edit note and note reading time). 
2. The analyst, in turn, can get the data either through created REST API (by http request) or by visiting website's \[link] page [ coming soon ]
3. And also there are graphs created [ coming soon ]
